## European Mediterranean earthquakes - an overview

The data that appears here has been downloaded from public websites. More specifically, the first maps we present here comes from INGV (http://storing.rm.ingv.it/es_web/). The database contains historical earthquakes for the European Mediterranean region. Publically available databases are great for dissemination of important historical information to the scientific community. However, among many challenges lies also the fact that many databases often exist concurrently, containing regional data or some covering a whole continent (e.g. Europe). The databases are commonly not updated at the same rate and usually largely overlap or dont allow same access "rights" to users. As such this is a source of confusion. This is part of an ongoing project which aims to shed light to all these databases available for the European Mediterranean region while making clear what each of these database contain and how much they differ. The Eastern Mediterranean region is highly seismogenic and therefore such work is of great importance.

Five datasets were downloaded from the INVG Euroseismos page that contain details on the data available for historical seismic events that happened as recently as 1999. As of April 2022 a total of 746 earthquakes are contained in the Italian database.
